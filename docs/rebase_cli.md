What is Git Rebase Squash? 
    Often developers will make numerous changes to a feature creating a large commit log history. Each commit is a way for developers to let team members know what they are adding or editing. 

    When dealing with long commit chains it becomes common practice to Squash the commit chains into one or a few commits before merging that work branch to the main branch. Squashing these commits can make the logs much more readable and easier to maintain for the entire team.
